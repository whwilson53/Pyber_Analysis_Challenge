 The industry is still mostly an urban and suburban phenomenon. However while rural ride count is small, the average fares are larger. 
 
## Reccomendations
1. More study should occur into the rural rideshare as that segment displays higher average fares than urban or suburban trips. 
2. Can we get more data about inter-market trips - for instance how many trips originated in a different market than the destination and how is that classified? The ride data is sectionalized it's hard to see the relationship between urban, rural, suburban rideshares.  
3. There are different trends from mid-April on - why is there a levelling off of urban, rural rides while suburban fare total increases? What's affecting demand in these locales?
